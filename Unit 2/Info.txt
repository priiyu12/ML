UNIT - 2
Data Visualization
• Creating histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data.
• Plotting scatter plots to explore relationships between two
continuous variables.
• Generating bar charts to compare frequencies of different categories
in a dataset.
• Constructing box plots to identify outliers and assess data
variability.
• Using heatmaps to visualize correlation matrices between features.
Hands-on Exercise
• Analyze a real-world dataset (e.g., Iris dataset, Titanic dataset)
using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
• Perform data cleaning operations (e.g., handling missing values,
removing outliers) on the dataset.
• Visualize key statistics and distributions of features using
appropriate plots.
• Implement data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling
and encoding.
• Implement feature extraction methods to extract the features.
